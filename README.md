# Data Service for ADAS and ADS Development

## Overview

This is an example of a data service typically used in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and automated driving systems (ADS) development. The data service is composed from following modular AWS services: [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/), [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift), [Amazon FSx](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/), [Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/), [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/), [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/), [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), [Amazon Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/), [Amazon Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/), [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/), [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/), [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), and [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

The typical use case addressed by this data service is to serve sensor data from a specified drive scene of interest, either in *batch mode* as a single [```rosbag```](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag)  file, or in *streaming mode* as an ordered series of ```rosbag``` files, whereby each ```rosbag``` file contains the drive scene data for a single time step, which by default is 1 second. Each ```rosbag``` file is dynamically composed from the drive scene data stored in [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/free/storage/s3), using the meta-data stored in [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/). 


## Key concepts

The data service runs in [Kubernetes Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) in an [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster configured to use [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.html) and EKS [Cluster Autoscaler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-autoscaler.html). 

An [Amazon Managed Service For Apache Kafka](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) (MSK) cluster provides the communication channel between the data service, and the client. The data service implements a *request-response* paradigm over Apache Kafka topics. However, the response data is not sent back over the Kafka topics. Instead, the data service stages the response data in Amazon S3, Amazon FSx, or Amazon EFS, as specified in the data client request, and the location of the response data is sent back to the data client over the Kafka topics. The data client directly reads the response data from its staged location.

### Data client request
Concretely, imagine the data client wants to request drive scene  data in ```rosbag``` file format from [A2D2 autonomous driving dataset](https://www.a2d2.audi/a2d2/en.html) for vehicle id ```a2d2```, drive scene id ```20190401145936```, starting at timestamp ```1554121593909500``` (microseconds) , and stopping at timestamp ```1554122334971448``` (microseconds). The data client wants the response to include data **only** from the ```front-left camera``` in ```sensor_msgs/Image``` [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) data type, and the ```front-left lidar``` in ```sensor_msgs/PointCloud2``` ROS data type. The data client wants the response data to be *streamed* back chunked in series of ```rosbag``` files, each file spanning ```1000000``` microseconds of the drive scene. Finally, the data client wants the response ```rosbag``` files to be stored on a shared Amazon FSx file system. 

The data client can encode such a data request using the JSON object shown below, and send it to the [Kafka bootstrap servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/msk-get-bootstrap-brokers.html)  ```b-1.msk-cluster-1:9092,b-2.msk-cluster-1:9092``` on the Apache Kafka topic named ```a2d2```:

```
{
	"servers": "b-1.msk-cluster-1:9092,b-2.msk-cluster-1:9092",
	"requests": [{
		"kafka_topic": "a2d2", 
		"vehicle_id": "a2d2",
		"scene_id": "20190401145936",
		"sensor_id": ["lidar/front_left", "camera/front_left"],
		"start_ts": 1554121593909500, 
		"stop_ts": 1554122334971448,
		"ros_topic": {"lidar/front_left": "/a2d2/lidar/front_left", 
				"camera/front_left": "/a2d2/camera/front_left"},
		"data_type": {"lidar/front_left": "sensor_msgs/PointCloud2",
				"camera/front_left": "sensor_msgs/Image"},
		"step": 1000000,
		"accept": "fsx/multipart/rosbag",
		"preview": false
	}]
}
```

For a detailed description of each request field shown in the example above, see [data request fields](#RequestFields) below.

## Tutorial step by step guide

### Overview
In this tutorial, we use [A2D2 autonomous driving dataset](https://www.a2d2.audi/a2d2/en.html). The high-level outline of this tutorial is as follows:

* Prerequisites
* Configure the data service
* Prepare the A2D2 data
* Run the data service
* Run the data service client


### Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes you have an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/), and you have [Administrator job function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html) access to the AWS Management Console.

To get started:

* Select your [AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html). The AWS Regions supported by this project include, us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-2, eu-west-1, eu-central-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, ap-northeast-1, ap-northeast-2, and ap-south-1. The [A2D2](https://registry.opendata.aws/aev-a2d2/) dataset used in this tutorial is stored in  ```eu-central-1```.
* Subscribe to [Ubuntu Pro 18.04 LTS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Amazon-Web-Services-Ubuntu-Pro-1804-LTS/B0821T9RL2) and [Ubuntu Pro 20.04 LTS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Amazon-Web-Services-Ubuntu-Pro-2004-LTS/B087L1R4G4).
* If you do not already have an Amazon EC2 key pair, [create a new Amazon EC2 key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#prepare-key-pair). You will need the key pair name to specify the ```KeyName``` parameter when creating the AWS CloudFormation stack below. 
* You will need an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket. If you don't have one, [create a new Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) in the selected AWS region. You will use the S3 bucket name to specify the ```S3Bucket``` parameter in the stack. The bucket is used to store the [A2D2](https://www.a2d2.audi/a2d2/en.html) data.
* Use the [public internet address](http://checkip.amazonaws.com/) of your laptop as the base value for the [CIDR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) to specify ```DesktopRemoteAccessCIDR``` parameter in the CloudFormation stack you will create below.  
* For all passwords used in this tutorial, we recommend using *strong* passwords using the best-practices recommended for [AWS root account user password](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_change-root.html).
* This tutorial assumes default values for all other parameters in the CloudFormation stack.

### Configure the data service

#### Create AWS CloudFormation Stack
The [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) template ```cfn/mozart.yml``` in this repository creates [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) resources, so when you [create the CloudFormation Stack using the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html), in the **Review** step, you must check 
**I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources.** 

Create a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the ```cfn/mozart.yml``` template. The stack input parameters you must specify are described below:

| Parameter Name | Parameter Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| KeyPairName | This is a *required* parameter whereby you select the Amazon EC2 key pair name used for SSH access to the desktop. You must have access to the selected key pair's private key to connect to your desktop. |
| RedshiftMasterUserPassword | This is a *required* parameter whereby you specify the Redshift database master user password.|
| DesktopRemoteAccessCIDR | This is a *required* parameter whereby you specify the public IP CIDR range from where you need remote access to your graphics desktop, e.g. 1.2.3.4/32, or 7.8.0.0/16. |
| DesktopInstanceType | This is a required parameter whereby you select an Amazon EC2 instance type for the ROS desktop. The default value, ```g3s.xlarge```, may not be available for your selected region, in which case, we recommend you try  ```g4dn.xlarge```, or one of the other instance types.
| S3Bucket | This is a *required* parameter whereby you specify the name of the Amazon S3 bucket to store your data. **The S3 bucket must already exist.** |

For all other stack input parameters, default values are recommended during first walkthrough. See complete list of all the [template input parameters](#InputParams) below. 

#### Key AWS resources

The key resources in the CloudFormation stack are listed below:

* A ROS desktop EC2 instance (default type ```g3s.xlarge```)
* An Amazon EKS cluster with 2 [managed node group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html) nodes (default type ```r5n.8xlarge```)
* An Amazon [MSK](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) cluster with 3 broker nodes (default type ```kafka.m5.2xlarge```)
* An Amazon [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) cluster with 3 nodes (default type ```ra3.4xlarge```)
* An Amazon [Fsx for Lustre](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/) file-system (default size 7,200  GiB)
* An Amazon [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) file-system

#### Connect to the graphics desktop using SSH

* Once the stack status in CloudFormation console is ```CREATE_COMPLETE```, find the desktop instance launched in your stack in the Amazon EC2 console, and [connect to the instance using SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) as user ```ubuntu```, using your SSH key pair.
* When you connect to the desktop using SSH, and you see the message ```"Cloud init in progress. Machine will REBOOT after cloud init is complete!!"```, disconnect and try later after about 20 minutes. The desktop installs the NICE DCV server on first-time startup, and reboots after the install is complete.
* If you see the message ```NICE DCV server is enabled!```, run the command ```sudo passwd ubuntu``` to set a new password for user ```ubuntu```. Now you are ready to connect to the desktop using the [NICE DCV client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/userguide/client.html)

#### Connect to the graphics desktop using NICE DCV Client
* Download and install the [NICE DCV client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/userguide/client.html) on your laptop.
* Use the NICE DCV Client to login to the desktop as user ```ubuntu```
* When you first login to the desktop using the NICE DCV client, you will be asked if you would like to upgrade the OS version. **Do not upgrade the OS version** .

Now you are ready to proceed with the following steps. For all the commands in this tutorial, we assume the *working directory* to be ``` ~/amazon-eks-autonomous-driving-data-service``` on the graphics desktop. 

#### Configure EKS cluster access

In this step, you need [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) for *programmatic* access for the IAM user, or role, you used to create the AWS CloudFormation stack above. You must not use the AWS credentials for a different IAM user, or role. The AWS credentials are used one-time to enable EKS cluster access from the ROS desktop, and are *automatically* *removed* at the end of this step. 

If you used an IAM role to create the CloudFormation stack above, you must manually configure the credentials associated with the IAM role in the ```~/.aws/credentials``` file with the following fields:

		aws_access_key_id=
		aws_secret_access_key=
		aws_session_token=

If you used an IAM user to create the stack, you do not have to manually configure the credentials in ```~/.aws/credentials``` file. 

In the *working directory*, run the command:

		./scripts/configure-eks-auth.sh

At the successful execution of this command, you *must* see ```AWS Credentials Removed```.

#### Setup EKS cluster environment

To setup the eks cluster environment, in the *working directory*, run the command:

		./scripts/setup-dev.sh

This step also builds and pushes the data service container image into [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).

### Prepare the A2D2 data

Before we can run the A2D2 data service, we need to extract the raw A2D2 data into your S3 bucket, extract the metadata from the raw data, and upload the metadata into the Redshift cluster. We execute these three steps using an [AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) state machine. To create and execute the AWS Step Functions state machine, execute the following command in the *working directory*:

		./scripts/a2d2-etl-steps.sh

Note the ```executionArn``` of the state machine execution in the output of the previous command. To check the status the status of the execution, use following command, replacing ```executionArn``` below with your value:

	aws stepfunctions describe-execution --execution-arn executionArn

You can see the status of the Step Function State Machine execution in the Step Functions console, as well. 

The state machine execution time depends on many variable factors and may take anywhere from 12 - 24 hours, or possibly longer.  You can see the status and the CloudWatch logs for each AWS Batch job spawned by the Step Function State Machine execution in the AWS Batch console. If a Batch job fails, it is automatically retried.

### Run the data service

*For best performance, [preload A2D2 data from S3 to FSx](#PreloadFSx). For a quick preview of the data service, you may proceed with the step below.*

The data service is deployed using an [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/), and runs as a ```kubernetes deployment``` in EKS. To start the data service, execute the following command in the *working directory*:

		helm install --debug a2d2-data-service ./a2d2/charts/a2d2-data-service/

To verify that the ```a2d2-data-service``` deployment is running, execute the command:

		kubectl get pods -n a2d2
		
#### Raw data input data source, and response data staging

The data service can be configured to input raw data from S3, FSx (see [Preload A2D2 data from S3 to FSx](#PreloadFSx) ), or EFS (see [Preload A2D2 data from S3 to EFS](#PreloadEFS) ).  Similarly, the data client can specify the ```accept``` field in the ```request``` to request that the response data be staged on S3, FSx, or EFS. The raw data input source is fixed when the data service is deployed. However, the response data staging option is specified in the data client request, and is therefore dynamic. 

Below is the Helm chart configuration in [```values.yaml```](a2d2/charts/a2d2-data-service/values.yaml) for various raw input data source options, with recommended Kubernetes resource requests for pod ```memory``` and ```cpu```:

 Raw input data source | ```values.yaml``` Configuration |
| --- | ----------- |
| ```fsx``` (default) | ```a2d2.requests.memory: "72Gi"``` <br> ```a2d2.requests.cpu: "8000m"``` <br> ```configMap.data_store.input: "fsx"```|
| ```efs```  | ```a2d2.requests.memory: "32Gi"``` <br> ```a2d2.requests.cpu: "1000m"``` <br> ```configMap.data_store.input: "efs"```|
| ```s3```  | ```a2d2.requests.memory: "8Gi"``` <br> ```a2d2.requests.cpu: "1000m"``` <br> ```configMap.data_store.input: "s3"```|

For matching response data staging options in data client request, see ```requests.accept``` field in [data request fields](#RequestFields). The recommended response data staging option for ```fsx``` raw data source is```"accept": "fsx/multipart/rosbag"```, for ```efs``` raw data source is```"accept": "efs/multipart/rosbag"```, and for ```s3``` raw data source is```"accept": "s3/multipart/rosbag"```

### Run the data service client


To visualize the response data requested by the A2D2 data client, we will use [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) tool on the graphics desktop. Open a terminal on the desktop, and run ```rviz```. In the ```rviz``` tool, use **File>Open Config** to select  ```/home/ubuntu/amazon-eks-autonomous-driving-data-service/a2d2/config/a2d2.rviz``` as the ```rviz``` config. You should see ```rviz``` tool now configured with two areas, one for visualizing image data, and the other for visualizing point cloud data.
  
To run the data client, execute the following command in the *working directory*:

		python ./a2d2/src/data_client.py \
			--config ./a2d2/config/c-config-ex1.json 1>/tmp/a.out 2>&1 & 

After a brief delay, you should be able to preview the response data in the ```rviz``` tool To preview data from a different drive scene, execute:

		python ./a2d2/src/data_client.py \
			--config ./a2d2/config/c-config-ex2.json 1>/tmp/a.out 2>&1 & 


You can set ```"preview": false``` in the data client config file, and run the above command to view the complete response, but before you do that, we recommend that for best performance, [preload A2D2 data from S3 to FSx](#PreloadFSx).

It is important that you do not run multiple data client instances on the ROS desktop concurrently. This is because the response data is played back on ROS topics, and there is only one ROS server running on the ROS desktop. Wait for a data client instance to exit, before you start another instance. Aborting the data client manually does not stop the data service pod from producing the response.

### Hard reset of the data service

This step is for reference purposes. If at any time you need to do a hard reset of the data service, you can do so by executing:

		helm delete a2d2-data-service

This will delete all data service EKS pods immediately. All in-flight service responses will be aborted. Because the connection between the data client and data service is asynchronous, the data clients may wait indefinitely, and you may need to cleanup the data client processes manually on the ROS desktop using operating system tools. Note, each data client instance spawns multiple Python processes. 

## Deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack

When you no longer need the data service , you may delete the AWS CloudFormation stack from the AWS CloudFormation console. Deleting the stack will terminate the desktop instance, and delete the EFS and FSx for Lustre file-systems created in the stack. The Amazon S3 bucket is not deleted.

### <a name="RequestFields"></a> Data client request fields
Below, we explain the semantics of the various fields in the data client request JSON object.

| Request field name | Request field description |
| --- | ----------- |
| ```servers``` | The ```servers``` identify the [AWS MSK](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) Kafka cluster endpoint. |
| ```delay``` | The ```delay``` specifies the delay in seconds that the data client delays sending the request. Default value is ```0```. |
| ```use_time``` | (Optional) The ```use_time``` specifies whether to use the ```received```  time, or ```header``` time when playing back the received messages. Default value is ```received```. |
| ```requests```| The JSON document sent by the client to the data service must include an array of one or more data ```requests``` for drive scene data. |
| ```requests.kafka_topic``` | The ```kafka_topic``` specifies the Kafka topic on which the data request is sent from the client to the data service. The data service is listening on the topic. |
| ```requests.vehicle_id``` | The ```vehicle_id``` is used to identify the relevant drive scene dataset. |
| ```requests.scene_id```  | The ```scene_id``` identifies the drive scene of interest, which in this example is ```20190401145936```, which in this example is a string representing the date and time of the drive scene, but in general could be any unique value. |
| ```requests.start_ts``` | The ```start_ts``` (microseconds) specifies the start timestamp for the drive scene data request. |
| ```requests.stop_ts``` | The ```stop_ts``` (microseconds) specifies the stop timestamp for the drive scene data request. |
| ```requests.ros_topic``` | The ```ros_topic``` is a dictionary from ```sensor ids``` in the vehicle to ```ros``` topics.|
| ```requests.data_type```| The ```data_type``` is a dictionary from ```sensor ids``` to ```ros``` data types.  |
| ```requests.step``` | The ```step``` is the discreet time interval (microseconds) used to discretize the timespan between ```start_ts``` and ```stop_ts```. If ```requests.accept``` value contains ```multipart```, the data service responds with a ```rosbag``` file for each discreet ```step```: See [possible values](#AcceptValues) below. |
| ```requests.accept``` | The ```accept``` specifies the response data staging format acceptable to the client: See [possible values](#AcceptValues) below. |
| ```requests.image``` | (Optional) The value ```undistorted``` undistorts the camera image. Undistoring an image slows down the image frame rate. Default value is ```original``` distorted image.|
| ```requests.lidar_view``` | (Optional) The value ```vehicle``` transforms lidar points to ```vehicle``` frame of reference view. Default value is ```camera```.|
|```requests.preview```| If the ```preview``` field is set to ```true```, the data service returns requested data over a single time ```step``` starting from ```start_ts``` , and ignores the ```stop_ts```.|

#### <a name="AcceptValues"></a>  Possible ```requests.accept``` field values

Below we describe the possible values for ```requests.accept``` field:

| ```requests.accept``` value | Description |
| --- | ----------- |

### <a name="PreloadFSx"></a>  Preload A2D2 data from S3 to FSx  

*This step can be executed anytime after "Configure the data service" step has been executed*

Amazon FSx for Lustre automatically lazy loads data from the configured S3 bucket. Therefore, this step is strictly a performance optimization step . However, for maximal performance, it is *highly recommended.* Execute following command to start preloading data from your S3 bucket to the FSx file-system:

	kubectl apply -n a2d2 -f a2d2/fsx/stage-data-a2d2.yaml
	
To check if the step is complete, execute:

	kubectl get pods stage-fsx-a2d2 -n a2d2

If the pod is still ```Running```, the step has not yet completed. This step takes approximately 5 hours to complete.


### <a name="PreloadEFS"></a> Preload A2D2 data from S3 to EFS 

*This step can be executed anytime after "Configure the data service" step has been executed*

This step is required **only** if you plan to configure the data service to use EFS as the raw data input source, otherwise, it may be safely skipped. Execute following command to start preloading data from your S3 bucket to the EFS file-system:

	kubectl apply -n a2d2 -f a2d2/efs/stage-data-a2d2.yaml

To check if the step is complete, execute:

	kubectl get pods stage-efs-a2d2 -n a2d2

If the pod is still ```Running```, the step has not yet completed. This step takes approximately 6.5 hours to complete.
